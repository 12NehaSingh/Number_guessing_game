# Number_guessing_game
This project is a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

# How to Play
1.The program generates a random number between 1 and 100(I have supposed this range).

2.The player is prompted to choose the level of difficulty: hard or easy.

3.In the hard level, the player has 5 chances to guess the number, while in the easy level, the player has 10 chances.

4.The player enters their guess.

5.If the guess is higher than the random number, the program displays "Too high guess" and updates the remaining chances.

6.If the guess is lower than the random number, the program displays "Too low guess" and updates the remaining chances.

7.If the guess is correct, the program displays "Right guess" and the player wins.

8.If the player runs out of chances without guessing the correct number, the program displays "You lose" and reveals the random number.
